# Updown Journey Project
An independent 2D game currently in development for the Sega Dreamcast, following the journey of a human character traveling from top to bottom. 



## Usage

### Running the game on hardware (BBA connection)


We assume the IP address of the Dreamcast is `10.42.0.80`
The dreamcast is connected to the network via a BBA (Broadband Adapter) through the ethernet port of the host machine.

```shell
make run-dc
```


### üîß Debugging Dreamcast Network Connection (DHCP Setup)

To allow your Dreamcast to get an IP address automatically over Ethernet (via BBA), you‚Äôll need to set up a lightweight DHCP server using `dnsmasq`.

#### 1. üß∞ Install `dnsmasq`

```bash
sudo apt install dnsmasq
```

---

#### 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Configure `dnsmasq`

Create a configuration file specifically for the Dreamcast setup:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.d/dreamcast.conf
```

Add the following content:

```ini
interface=<your-dreamcast-interface>
bind-interfaces

dhcp-range=192.168.0.50,192.168.0.150,12h
dhcp-option=3,192.168.0.1
dhcp-option=6,8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1
```

üîÅ **Replace** `<your-dreamcast-interface>` with the name of your Ethernet-to-USB adapter or relevant NIC (e.g., `enxa0cec85e02d8`).  
You can find it using:

```bash
ip addr
```

Look for the interface that is **connected to the Dreamcast** (usually shows as `DOWN` when unplugged, `UP` when plugged in).

---

#### 3. üîÑ Restart `dnsmasq`

```bash
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```

---

#### 4. üì° Find the Dreamcast IP

While your Dreamcast is booted into `dcload-ip` (or a network-enabled app/game):

```bash
sudo journalctl -u dnsmasq -f
```

Look for a block like:

```text
DHCPDISCOVER(enx...) ...
DHCPOFFER(enx...) 192.168.0.85 ...
DHCPREQUEST ...
DHCPACK ...
```

The IP address offered (e.g., `192.168.0.85`) is the one you‚Äôll use with tools like `dc-tool-ip`.

#### Connection Troubleshooting
dcload-ip is not receiving an IP address

If your Dreamcast isn‚Äôt being assigned an IP address, you can check what's going wrong by inspecting the system journal:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u dnsmasq -f
```

If you see a message like this:

```text
HCP packet received on <your-dreamcast-interface> which has no address
```
It means that your Dreamcast is sending a DHCP request, but your network adapter (usually the USB-Ethernet interface) doesn‚Äôt have an IP address assigned to it ‚Äî so dnsmasq can‚Äôt respond.

To fix this, assign a static IP address to the adapter:

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.1/24 dev <your-dreamcast-interface>
sudo ip link set <your-dreamcast-interface> up
```

Then restart dnsmasq
```bash
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```

Finally, verify that the IP address has been correctly assigned:
```bash
ip addr show <your-dreamcast-interface>
```

## Debugging cmake

```bash
source /opt/toolchains/dc/kos/environ.sh
cmake -S . -B build/build-test -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build/build-test/  -- -j 4

export CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=gdb
cmake --build build/build-test/ --config Debug --target all --verbose
```
```bash
cmake --build build --target updown -- -j 4
```
```bash
cmake --build build --target updown -- -j 4 -- VERBOSE=1
```

### Hints

- kos toolchains seems to have issues with ninja (floating-point exception)
Need to put in settings.json Makefile as generator:
```json
{
    "cmake.generator": "Unix Makefiles"
}
```
